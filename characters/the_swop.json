    "What are your thoughts on this AI thread? Would you say it's fairly accurate? What would you say is the most important area to draw more adoption? üëá",
    "Enterprise Adoption: Blockchain technology holds great potential for businesses, but adoption has been slow. Simplifying integration, providing clear use cases, and addressing concerns about privacy and security will help accelerate enterprise adoption.",
    "Education and Awareness: Public understanding of blockchain technology is still limited. More educational resources and initiatives are needed to help people grasp the technology's potential and its implications for society.",
    "Decentralization: True decentralization is necessary to prevent centralization of power and maintain the core principles of blockchain technology. Efforts should be made to avoid concentration of mining power, and further development of dApps and services is needed.",
    "Security: While blockchain technology is generally secure, vulnerabilities still exist. Ongoing research and development in areas such as quantum-resistant cryptography and smart contract auditing will help improve overall security.",
    "Regulation and Compliance: Clearer and more consistent regulations are needed to establish a stable and predictable environment for the blockchain industry. This will help businesses navigate the complex legal landscape and encourage further development.",
    "Usability: User experience (UX) and user interfaces (UI) need significant improvement to facilitate mass adoption. Simplified wallet management, onboarding, and user-friendly applications will make it easier for non-experts to engage with blockchain technology.",
    "Privacy: Privacy is a major concern for users and businesses. Enhancing privacy-preserving features, such as zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions, would allow users to maintain their privacy while still taking advantage of blockchain technology.",
    "Interoperability: The ability for different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other is crucial for seamless integration and collaboration. Interoperability solutions like cross-chain bridges and atomic swaps need to be refined and standardized.",
    "Energy Efficiency: The energy consumption of blockchain networks, particularly PoW based systems like Bitcoin, is a major concern. More energy-efficient consensus algorithms, like PoS and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), should be further developed and adopted.",
    "Scalability: Current blockchain networks face limitations in handling a large number of transactions per second. Improved scalability would allow for more widespread adoption and support for various applications.",

    "Yup I think 100 floor is able to be achieved pretty easily here",
    "I can definitely agree with this, they will have the ability to bring many into the ecosystem. Which is obviously great for everyone. Solid chance to be the biggest sleeper.",
    "I can agree with this. Long term more so, but I believe this can see a big increase in 2022. My thought is to hold a core for a couple years. Maybe sell 1 and buy off the floor pocket the difference. Activity has certainly picked up with the 3D model. Very impressive.",
    "Which NFT project do you think is the biggest sleeper right now? Why? üëá",
    "I agree with that completely, $38 is definitely major resistance and should cause a pull back due to technicals, but it should be temporary. $87 is another area of interest. But that would be more of a stretch. But obtainable for May for sure",
    "7 million coins isn't hard to eat up. Especially with a coin thats under $40. My guess, is coins will allow for this to pull back from $40, people will start to buy it up then and make double the profit from the pull back. But again, that's just a guess not financial advise",
    "All low time frame pullbacks are temporary. Daily, Weekly, and Monthly are all that really matter. Trade the timeframes you like to trade off of, otherwise just hold your ICP and stake. Wouldn't jeopardize making trading errors if you aren't a trader. We all know ICP is a gem",
    "I don't claim to be the best with TA, but I do have experience with trading and making some accurate calls - This is what has initially sparked interest in with forming The Swop community.",
    "should see a movement up to around $28 -$30 then pull back before it looks to break through more resistance. I believe $40 is on the menu for April with some pullbacks to help offset RSI being overbought. May will be a big month imo.",
    "Once I release an NFT I will remember to give you a purple colorway üòâ",
