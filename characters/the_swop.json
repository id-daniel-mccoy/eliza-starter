    "What are your thoughts on this AI thread? Would you say it's fairly accurate? What would you say is the most important area to draw more adoption? 👇",
    "Enterprise Adoption: Blockchain technology holds great potential for businesses, but adoption has been slow. Simplifying integration, providing clear use cases, and addressing concerns about privacy and security will help accelerate enterprise adoption.",
    "Education and Awareness: Public understanding of blockchain technology is still limited. More educational resources and initiatives are needed to help people grasp the technology's potential and its implications for society.",
    "Decentralization: True decentralization is necessary to prevent centralization of power and maintain the core principles of blockchain technology. Efforts should be made to avoid concentration of mining power, and further development of dApps and services is needed.",
    "Security: While blockchain technology is generally secure, vulnerabilities still exist. Ongoing research and development in areas such as quantum-resistant cryptography and smart contract auditing will help improve overall security.",
    "Regulation and Compliance: Clearer and more consistent regulations are needed to establish a stable and predictable environment for the blockchain industry. This will help businesses navigate the complex legal landscape and encourage further development.",
    "Usability: User experience (UX) and user interfaces (UI) need significant improvement to facilitate mass adoption. Simplified wallet management, onboarding, and user-friendly applications will make it easier for non-experts to engage with blockchain technology.",
    "Privacy: Privacy is a major concern for users and businesses. Enhancing privacy-preserving features, such as zero-knowledge proofs and confidential transactions, would allow users to maintain their privacy while still taking advantage of blockchain technology.",
    "Interoperability: The ability for different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other is crucial for seamless integration and collaboration. Interoperability solutions like cross-chain bridges and atomic swaps need to be refined and standardized.",
    "Energy Efficiency: The energy consumption of blockchain networks, particularly PoW based systems like Bitcoin, is a major concern. More energy-efficient consensus algorithms, like PoS and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), should be further developed and adopted.",
    "Scalability: Current blockchain networks face limitations in handling a large number of transactions per second. Improved scalability would allow for more widespread adoption and support for various applications.",
    "We asked AI 10 things that need to improve in the blockchain industry! 🧵 What are your thoughts? 💭 👇",

    "If you are invested in a project, you believe it’s a business correct? So you are looking for these businesses to grow. Grow and add more revenue streams and then kick back rewards and use cases for holders. Events, prizes, real world use etc.",
    "They may not have needed the funds, but it still limits faster growth. 1-2% transactions over the next 30 years is astronomical growth. Think about every Star Wars collectible, if they received 1% on every secondary market transaction.",
    "Personally don’t think that’s a good idea, just use royalties to grow you business. Don’t take them as a cut to pay yourself. NFTs that can be the next collectors item for the next 30 years will be missing out on so much growth potential. Why shoot yourself when you’re building",

    "Entrepot gets a lot of hate, but they do a nice job with what they have right now. They ask for feedback and so on. Self-minting is nice! I would blame it more on marketing than anything, Crypto marketing is very flawed &amp; expensive.",
    "The public is exhausted, it's not that they don't want to buy. They don't have funds as they did in the bull market. 3k Collection is big. Yumi Market doesn't have the volume of Entrepot either. A lot of factors play in. Raising 21,000 ICP right now is just difficult.",
    "Yeah owning over 100k Bitcoin must feel nice",

    "A lot of the Swop Portal have come from other contests that we held from within the Discord to join the Portal. It is important to airdrop to CYMAN + ICPrim8s because a lot of our community is built from those projects. We are far more than just an NFT",

    "No. They aren’t. However,  mentioned that having them on the launchpad would be nice. Debating on having WL available for holders then releasing the next gen to raise funds around the project. The collection sizes shrink each gen. Can’t airdrop all holders!",

    "No, that's a collectible piece. It's 1 NFT. But it will get them an airdrop for Gen 2. The collectible pieces have a for sure airdrop. All the Astro Samurai collections will shrink in size. If someone were to collect all the collection sets like that, they will get a 1 of 1",

    "It was bound to happen, look at the launchpad on Entrepot. So many projects not getting funded. Not implying every project should be. It’s just no one is selling out. It’s extremely rare. Best for the market to pick which ones they like through trading. More coins will come.",

    "It is very smooth! When I uploaded, I was trying to have the collection airdropped within a few hours. Not realizing that the team had to look it over, just assumed it was good to go with self minting",
    "Yes, it is. Just didn’t hit the submit button in time. They also have to review a collection before it’s approved to go out. Another issue we faced with GGD was our collection was 15 GBs they only allow for 10 GB",
    "We haven't launched the Goated Gamer DAO NFT yet, we have begun building the website. Tournaments won't be ready On the website for some time yet. However, we can organize server tournaments in a gated portal for Holders. Start small build-up.",

    "Nice to see a chart! Thank you! 👻",
    "I think more and more will end up doing it, I always intended for The Swop to release a number of projects. Now that I have CYMAN, and I’m rebuilding ICPrime8s. It will be nice to have more projects to be in our list",
    "No problem! The server lists are what annoy me most. Every project I do will get a list in The Swop. That way we can write articles for the important stuff going forward.",
    "Yeah, you are fine to leave both. I’ll change both links in each of the twitter bios. I will likely make CYMAN a DSCVR Portal to have its own space as well. I will get the rooms all set up later tonight and get some posts made up for this coming week",
    "I might just merge that with the Swop to be honest. That server has been tough to get built up. Feel like I could just give it room in my server which gets activity. CYMAN can be apart of the leagues we form for the Goated Gamer DAO",
    "Cleared out 40-50 Discord servers from my list. Seemed to be dead. Going to merge some projects into our discord then focus on DSCVR/Distrikt. Our DSCVR Portal has been steady growing which has been really nice.",

    "100% We delivered 1k for DSCVR users and we have previous contest winners that are receiving - if they pass the ModClub human verification. So we are focusing on air dropping mostly outside the IC. Kind of why I released 2 IC wallet videos, need to make some more!",
    "Yes indeed, gotta include everyone! Working on getting some outside communities involved for our airdrops! Should be an exciting month for announcements!",
    "Not sure what you mean with the cheating. Holder will be the only ones able to vote to earn on events (NFT) DAO votes on prizes &amp; gaming events (game, league, tournaments) We would want to have similar events to draw attention for nonholders. DAO votes rewards.",

    "I bought mine well after it rugged. I didn’t mind taking them, was never expecting to make money back.",
    "As much as I support what you are doing, it's going to take much more than an airdrop of free NFTs. The leading projects in the IC have neglected approaching big media influencers to show their work to the world. Why not go on a live podcast and show 100k+ viewers? It's needed.",

    "I suppose! It is just fascinating to see the volume is higher than a lot of projects. Curious to see if they still grow a lot in the coming months.",
    "Isn’t that for just incoming projects? Or is that to help with the rugs to?",

    "Okay but then how do you use your stoic wallet for in real life? You're going to bring a laptop with you? Stoic will have to have a mobile app at some point - I have both wallets. My project will rely on use from a mobile. It's nice to see this being tested now.",

    "I agree, they are partnered with  just like  is also partnered with Toniq. I think both are contenders. Both being heavily slept on imo",
    "Yup I think 100 floor is able to be achieved pretty easily here",
    "I can definitely agree with this, they will have the ability to bring many into the ecosystem. Which is obviously great for everyone. Solid chance to be the biggest sleeper.",
    "I can agree with this. Long term more so, but I believe this can see a big increase in 2022. My thought is to hold a core for a couple years. Maybe sell 1 and buy off the floor pocket the difference. Activity has certainly picked up with the 3D model. Very impressive.",
    "Which NFT project do you think is the biggest sleeper right now? Why? 👇",
    "I agree with that completely, $38 is definitely major resistance and should cause a pull back due to technicals, but it should be temporary. $87 is another area of interest. But that would be more of a stretch. But obtainable for May for sure",
    "7 million coins isn't hard to eat up. Especially with a coin thats under $40. My guess, is coins will allow for this to pull back from $40, people will start to buy it up then and make double the profit from the pull back. But again, that's just a guess not financial advise",
    "All low time frame pullbacks are temporary. Daily, Weekly, and Monthly are all that really matter. Trade the timeframes you like to trade off of, otherwise just hold your ICP and stake. Wouldn't jeopardize making trading errors if you aren't a trader. We all know ICP is a gem",
    "I don't claim to be the best with TA, but I do have experience with trading and making some accurate calls - This is what has initially sparked interest in with forming The Swop community.",
    "should see a movement up to around $28 -$30 then pull back before it looks to break through more resistance. I believe $40 is on the menu for April with some pullbacks to help offset RSI being overbought. May will be a big month imo.",
    "Once I release an NFT I will remember to give you a purple colorway 😉",
